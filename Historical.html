		<span id="s1"> Rites of Spring</span>
		<br>
		In a trailblazing, iconoclastic work of cultural history, Eksteins links the modern avant-garde's penchant for primitivism, abstraction and myth-making to the protofascist ideology and militarism unleashed by WW I. For Eksteins, professor of history at the University of Toronto, the seminal modernist artwork is Igor Stravinsky's 1913 ballet The Rite of Spring , a celebration of life through sacrificial death. Moving easily between the cafes of Montmartre and the battlefields of Flanders and Verdun, this brilliant, eloquent study ties the modernists' flight from history to the warring powers' preoccupation with speed, regimentation and newness, the Germans' mythic invocation of a tribal and folk past, Mussolini's esthetic of brutality. Eksteins observes that the bloody Western Front in WW I was a ``surrealistic'' landscape before poet-soldier Guillaume Apollinaire invented the term in 1917. He interprets Lindbergh's solo crossing of the Atlantic in terms of Gide's ``perfectly free act,'' one devoid of meaning other than its own inner energy and accomplishment. This provocative and disturbing reappraisal of modernism rings with authority.

		<span id="s2"> The History of Ancient World</span>
		<br>
		This is the first volume in a bold new series that tells the stories of all peoples, connecting historical events from Europe to the Middle East to the far coast of China, while still giving weight to the characteristics of each country.

		<br>Susan Wise Bauer provides both sweeping scope and vivid attention to the individual lives that give flesh to abstract assertions about human history.

		<br>Dozens of maps provide a clear geography of great events, while timelines give the reader an ongoing sense of the passage of years and cultural interconnection. This narrative history employs the methods of “history from beneath”—literature, epic traditions, private letters and accounts—to connect kings and leaders with the lives of those they ruled. The result is an engrossing tapestry of human behavior from which we may draw conclusions about the direction of world events and the causes behind them.

		<span id="s3"> Guns, Germs and Steel</span>
		<br>
		Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fate of Human Societies isn’t the history of one particular place, people, or period, it is an examination of what happened to a range of peoples in a host of places and times based on agriculture, disease, and other factors, like luck. History happened the way it happened not because one group of people was innately better than any other, but simply because some folks first developed better weapons or learned how to grow more food than the next culture over. But for slight changes, it all could have been different. (Not necessarily better, mind you, just different.)
